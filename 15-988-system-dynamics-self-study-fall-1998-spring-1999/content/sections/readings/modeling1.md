description: Reading assignment. This paper is the first in a series of papers designed
  to utilize and enhance the modeling capabilities of the reader. The beginning of
  this paper outlines the importance and the process of model building. This paper
  also contains three separate modeling exercises. Each exercise begins with a brief
  description of the system after which the reader constructs a system dynamics model
  of the system. The reader then runs the model under varying conditions and answers
  some questions. This paper is not intended as an introduction to system dynamics
  or model building. The reader is expected to have prior experience with both. Solutions
  to all the exercises are included at the end. The modeling exercises are presented
  approximately in order of difficulty, but need not be done in this sequence.
